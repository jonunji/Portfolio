I began my interest in Computer Science 8 years ago, and in Spring of 2023, I will be receiving a B.S. degree in the field. Over the course of my education, I have gathered a lot of experience and knowledge, and intend to use it to create new software in the future.

In June of 2019, I started working on my first major title, Mousebound. After many iterations and undertaking new projects, I have arrived here, to the about section of a portfolio. I believe the work I have done speaks for itself, so thanks for stopping by!

and it is important to take a step back and look at what can be accomplished with persistance, passion, and time.

I began my interest in Computer Science 8 years ago, and in Spring of 2023, I will be receiving a B.S. degree in the field. As I begin my professional career after academia, I hope to push boundaries and make great software, as I have done and attempted during my time at school.



Hi, I'm Jonathan (some people call me Jonji, kinda like Jumanji)! I am studying Computer Science at the University of Central Florida, expecting to graduate in Spring 2023. I find programming lots of fun, especially when I can be creative with it, which is why I have a lot of time invested in game development!<br/>

Another reason I have a lot of time invested: If you have ever programmed before, you know the <i><b>magical<b/><i/> feeling of getting really complex logic to finally work out. You also know what it's like to try to solve a problem for 4 hours when you could have been done with it within 20 minutes normally. Sometimes making the perfect program is what's more important.<br/>

When I'm not trying to get Linux to run correctly, you can find me at the gym, playing guitar, cooking, or watching a new show. I still think about the ending of Better Call Saul.<br/>

If you'd like to reach out to me, do so here. I'd be delighted to hear from you!
